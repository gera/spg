The Simple Password Generator is a simple way to remember passwords. You
choose a single secret phrase. For a password for a site "website", it
generates the password as the first eight characters of the MD5 hash of (
secret-prase + "website").

You just have to remember one phrase and you have a unique system of
passwords.

The idea behind this was originally taken from a system described in one of
the comments on a blog ( url :
