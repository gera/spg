The Simple Password Generator is a simple way to remember passwords. You
choose a single secret phrase. For a password for a site "website", it
generates the password as the first eight characters of the MD5 hash of (
secret-prase + "website").

You just have to remember one phrase and you have a unique system of
passwords.

The idea behind this was originally taken from a system described in one of
the comments on a blog ( url :
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/how_to_harvest.html#c220047 ).

A very basic (and somewhat broken) readline support exists on the win32
platform via the 'alternative readline' module (from
http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/readline.html). This is mostly
incompatible with the other win32 readline replacement - pyreadline.
